## Purpose

Clear ownership is the backbone of a compliance program. Without it, controls go untested, evidence goes uncollected, and audits fail. This register defines every key stakeholder in the ResolvX GRC program, their responsibilities, and the control domains they are accountable for.

Every control in the ResolvX control matrix maps back to an owner defined here.

| Role | Definition |
|---|---|
| **R — Responsible** | Does the work — implements or operates the control |
| **A — Accountable** | Owns the outcome — signs off, escalation point |
| **C — Consulted** | Provides input or expertise before decisions are made |
| **I — Informed** | Kept up to date on progress and outcomes |
